# Hasura Data Hub

Explore data sources from a native GraphQL API, database schemas to custom code contributed by the community.

The side effect of the massive explosion of data is that it is spread across different databases, on-prem/cloud and external APIs. The “source of truth” is distributed across multiple data sources. Remote Joins in Hasura solves this data access problem by treating all these different sources as if it were one database and giving developers access to precise slices of data.

Hasura Data Hub allows you to discover, reuse and collaborate with the community around the GraphQL and Hasura ecosystem.

Featuring native GraphQL APIs and samples of

- Remote Schemas with Joins
- Installable Database Schemas with Metadata
- Actions with transformers (coming soon)
- Events with transformers (coming soon)

## Contribute

The Data Hub is built for the community. Feel free to open a pull request to add your own version of Remote Schema or a database schema with metadata. We are more than happy to include them and share it with the developers. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for more details.
